# SpriteRecolorer
A program for quickly recoloring a big amount of sprites.

This program compares 2 versions of a sprite and compares their colors creating a list of colors to be replaced with different colors which it then uses to recolor an entire directory of different sprites.
This allows you to quickly recolor sprites that don't use a palette by simply recoloring a simple sprite.
It's also possible to use an image only containing the colors that you want to replace so a 1x2 image is still a valid input if all you want to do is replace 2 colors.
